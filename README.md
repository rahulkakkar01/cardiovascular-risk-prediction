Cardiovascular Risk Predictor
This project is a machine learning-based application developed by Rahul Kakkar in Python using Tkinter to predict cardiovascular disease risk based on input health parameters.

Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This application aims to assist in early detection and risk assessment by predicting the likelihood of CVDs based on user-provided health data.

Features
Data Handling: The application preprocesses input data to handle missing values and normalize numerical features for accurate model training.

Model Training: Implements logistic regression to train a predictive model using processed data, providing insights into potential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.

User Interface: Utilizes Tkinter for creating a user-friendly graphical interface. Users can input relevant health parameters and receive immediate predictions regarding their cardiovascular disease risk.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt or setup instructions)
Usage
Install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run python main.py to launch the application.
Input relevant health parameters when prompted.
View the predicted cardiovascular disease risk and accompanying insights.
Future Improvements
Incorporate more advanced machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, neural networks) for comparison and enhanced accuracy.
Enhance the user interface for improved interactivity and visual feedback.
Expand the dataset and improve model robustness by integrating more diverse and comprehensive health data sources.
